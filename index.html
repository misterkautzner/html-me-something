                <h3 id="beginning">Beginning</h3>
                <p>John first came into contact with computer 
                    science while pursuing his bachelor's 
                    degree at Southeast Missouri State 
                    University.  He took a class in C++ 
                    and loved it.  He thought it was so cool 
                    that you could "solve problems once and 
                    for all" by writing a program that could 
                    solve a generalized problem.  It took a 
                    higher initial investment of time than 
                    calculating something by hand, but 
                    eventually, if the problem needed to be 
                    solved enough times with different 
                    parameters, the program could save a LOT 
                    of time.

                <p>After graduating, John became an Adjunct 
                    instructor at a community college.  
                    Unfortunately, John wanted a career and 
                    his position with the college was only 
                    part-time.  When he saw the full list of 
                    adjunct instructors in the math 
                    department, he realized it would be
                    years before he could become a fulltime 
                    instructor.  John needed to get into a new 
                    field.  After talking with a friend in 
                    the tech field, he decided to pursue 
                    programming.
                </p>
                <p>John used online resources and guidance from 
                    his friend to get started.  However, After 
                    a while it became very difficult to find 
                    resources at the right level.

                <p>
                    John decided it would be worth it to join 
                    a programming bootcamp because of the time 
                    it would save him.  He enrolled in one.  
                    However, he did not receive the education 
                    he expected.  There were major problems with 
                    the program, but he was able to learn enough 
                    to get a job in the field.

                <p>
                    As a software developer, John was behind in 
                    terms of skill.  He struggled a lot, but made 
                    improvements over time.  His company found a 
                    place where he could become successful.

                <p>
                    John really wanted to improve himself 
                    professionally.  In order to do so, he knew 
                    that he would have to strengthen his fundamentals 
                    and learn the things he had missed along the way.  
                    He joined LaunchCode to this end.  He didn't learn 
                    much new in the first Unit, but by the first week of 
                    Unit 2, he could tell that he was going to learn a lot.  
                    Stay tuned...
